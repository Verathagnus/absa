For deployment, I first created the python script with flask for testing it on colab with ngrok.
The api request should be in the form:-
{
  'model': 'MODEL_TYPE', 
  'modelfile': 'MODEL_FILE_NAME', 
  'text': 'TEXT', 
  'aspect': 'ASPECT'
}
For example, inferencing for an logistic regression model with modelfile value should be
{
  'model': 'lr', 
  'modelfile': '', 
  'text': 'text for inferencing sentence', 
  'aspect': 'text for aspect terms'
}
The resulting output received should be of the form:-
{
  "sentiment":0
}
After testing the api on postman with the help of ngrok on colab notebook, the AWS instance was created and the files were uploaded using WinSCP.
Then putty was used to connect to the instance with the private key. The necessary libraries were installed and the api script was run.
The instance id for deployment is given by:-
ec2-3-109-208-2.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
with port 8080 for accepting requests.
The server is made using waitress.
An example of api url is given by:
http://ec2-3-109-208-2.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/predict?model=svc&modelname=&text=hey%20marilyn%20thanks%20for%20your%20answer%20the%20soc2%20type%201%20certification%20is%20a%20document%20that%20can%20be%20shared%20with%20external%20parties%20for%20security%20assessment%20do%20you%20have%20a%20copy%20of%20the%20report%20we%20could%20explore?&aspect=Security
which gives result 
{
  "sentiment":1
}
